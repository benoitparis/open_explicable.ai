      <description>While achieving great predictive power, machine learning models can be really opaque for their users; be it a data science team, a marketing executive, a salesperson, or the end user. For example in classification we are often left with a probability distribution, and absolutely no intuition of the relations inside the dataset at hand.
DARPA has recently launched a program aimed just at that: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). We believe this will be an indispensible part of Machine Learning in the future, and has great potential in being applied to marketing data.</description>
